# CSCI495-C6

## Description / Purpose
The purpose of the project was to show that I can really make something that people would use and that people could take from. Using an API and other things that really advance a simple JS project to something more than it could be without an API as well. I am very disappointed that I was not able to get it running, BUT failure is necessary to grow, and something is always learned from failure, whether you see it initially or not. 

## Dependencies
"devDependencies":
    "babel-core": "^6.26.0",

## Usage
HTML CSS Grid, JS, Webpack, Babel, uniquid, Node.js, External API 

## Future Work
For future work, I want it to actually work. I would like the API to actually connect and the Webpack server to connect. I would have made this project well worth it and I think that it really could be something I can add to my resume.


## What is your major and how this project is related to your major.
Once again, my major is IS and when i graduate I want to go into Web Development. This is essentially my first JS application working with an API and I am upset that it didn't work as planned but I am not upset with the fact that I failed. Failing is apart of learning and you with never learn if you never fail.
